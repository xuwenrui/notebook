## Why Do Cats Always Sleep?

Many people think cats always sleep.  
This is because cats sleep more than humans.

First, cats sleep to save energy.  
Cats are hunters by nature.  
Even house cats have the same body as wild cats.  
Sleeping helps them store energy for running and jumping.

Second, cats are more active at night.  
Cats often sleep during the day.  
They wake up early in the morning or at night.  
So we see them sleeping most of the time.

Third, sleep helps cats stay healthy.  
When cats sleep, their body rests and grows.  
Young cats and old cats need more sleep.

Finally, cats sleep more when they feel safe.  
A cat sleeps a lot when it is relaxed and comfortable.  
This means the cat is happy.

In short, cats sleep a lot to save energy, stay healthy, and feel safe.
