my kid can't take a action on classes. but can't play toys, watch TV , play electronic games or listen potcast story with long time. if need to change.

My kid can’t focus in class,  
but he can play with toys, watch TV, play electronic games,  
or listen to stories for a long time.  
Do I need to change this?

## Is this normal?
**Yes. This is very common for kids.**
Many children:
- cannot focus in class
- but can focus on games, TV, or stories
This does **not** mean your kid is lazy or bad.
## Why does this happen?
### 1️⃣ Classes are passive*(-  [ˈpæsɪv]消极的; 被动的;)

In class:
- kids must sit still
- listen quietly
- cannot choose what to do
This is hard for many children.
---
### 2️⃣ Games and stories are interesting
Toys, TV, and games:
- move fast
- give rewards（奖赏）
- are fun
So kids focus **without effort**.（- ˈefərt努力; 吃力;）
---
### 3️⃣ Children’s brains are still growing
Kids:
- learn through play
- have short attention spans（ 一段时间）
- need movement
This is normal development.
---
## Do you need to change it?
👉 **Not completely. Do not force（- [fɔːrs]强行） a big change.**
But you can **guide slowly**.
---
## What you can do (simple steps)
### ✅ 1️⃣ Limit screen time, not ban it
- Set clear time (for example: 30–60 minutes)
- Same rule every day
No arguing（- ɑrgjʊɪŋ争吵，辩论）, just routine(-  [ruːˈtiːn]惯例，常规;).

---
### ✅ 2️⃣ Add short “focus time”
- 10–15 minutes only
- Reading, drawing, homework
- Then rest or play

Small time is enough.
---
### ✅ 3️⃣ More outdoor play
Outdoor play:
- helps eyes
- helps attention
- reduces stress

No need to be long.  
Even **20–30 minutes** is good.
---
### ✅ 4️⃣ Don’t compare with other kids

Every child is different.  
Comparing makes kids anxious（- ˈæŋkʃəs焦虑的，担心的）.

---
## When should you worry?
See a professional **only if**:
- the child never listens
- cannot finish any task
- behavior is very extreme（-  [ɪkˈstriːm]极其的; 极端的）

Most children **grow out of this**.
---
## One important thing for parents
> **Children change slowly, not suddenly.**
Your job is:
- guide
- protect
- give structure（- 构造; 建筑物; 周密安排）
    
Not to “fix” them.
You are already a caring（关心的） parent — that matters most.
If you want, next time you can tell me:
- your kid’s age
- what he likes most
    

He is a boy and six years old this year. yes. I control he plays ipad time in 20 minutes every day. but don't control he listen to story time. I don't make sure this time if need control. and he doesn't sleep after lunch on noon. by school rule need sleep voer 1 hour after lunch and don't play or out. even don't sleep still need lie. He haven't routine to sleep on noon. but can't wake up on time in the morning.
I think He can't focus in class or don't sleep on noon maybe cause miss exercise.

He is a boy and he is six years old.  
I control his iPad time to 20 minutes every day,  
but I do not control his story listening time.  
I am not sure if I should control it.

He does not sleep after lunch.  
At school, children must lie down for more than one hour.  
Even if they don’t sleep, they must stay in bed.

He has no habit of sleeping at noon,  
but he cannot wake up on time in the morning.

I think he can’t focus in class,  
or he doesn’t sleep at noon,  
maybe because he doesn’t get enough exercise.


## Now, about your child (important part)
### 1️⃣ iPad control (you are doing well)
👉 **20 minutes a day is very good.**  
This is healthy and reasonable（- [ˈriːznəbl]合理的，公道的; 明智的; 不少的;）.
You don’t need to feel guilty（-  [ˈɡɪlti] - 内疚的; 有罪的） about this.

### 2️⃣ Story listening time — should you control it?

**Usually, no need to control it strictly.**

Listening to stories:

- is passive (not strong stimulation)
    
- helps language and imagination
    
- is much better than games or videos
    

But:

- don’t listen too late at night
    
- keep volume low
    
- stop before sleep
    

👉 Story time is **OK**, even good.

---

### 3️⃣ No noon sleep — very common at age 6

Many 6-year-old boys:

- don’t feel sleepy at noon
    
- hate lying still for 1 hour
    
- feel bored and stressed
    

The school rule is for **group management**, not for every child’s body.

👉 **Not sleeping at noon is NOT a problem by itself.**

---

### 4️⃣ Morning tired + poor focus — your key insight is correct

You said something very important:

> maybe because he doesn’t get enough exercise

👉 **Yes. This is very possible.**

Lack of exercise can cause:

- poor focus in class
    
- too much energy inside
    
- trouble falling asleep at night
    
- hard to wake up in the morning
    

---

## What helps most (simple and realistic)

### ✅ 1️⃣ Add daily physical exercise

This is more important than noon sleep.

Examples:

- running
    
- cycling
    
- ball games
    
- playground time
    

**30–60 minutes every day is ideal.**

---

### ✅ 2️⃣ Earlier bedtime (very important)

If he doesn’t nap:

- he needs to sleep earlier at night
    

Try:

- same bedtime every day
    
- no screen before bed
    
- quiet activity (story, drawing)
    

---

### ✅ 3️⃣ Accept “lying down but not sleeping”

If he lies quietly:

- body still rests
    
- brain calms down
    

That is already helpful.

---

## One important thing for parents

> **Boys at this age need to move first, then focus.**

Not:

- sit first
    
- then focus
    

Movement comes first.

---

## Final reassurance

Your child:

- is normal
    
- is not broken
    
- does not need “fixing”
    

He needs:

- movement
    
- routine
    
- time
    

And you are already paying attention — that matters most.

If you want, next time I can help you:

- make a simple daily routine
    
- or suggest exercise ideas for a 6-year-old boy
    

Just tell me 🙂
