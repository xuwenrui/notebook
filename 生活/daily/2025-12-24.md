my kid can't take a action on classes. but can't play toys, watch TV , play electronic games or listen potcast story with long time. if need to change.

My kid can’t focus in class,  
but he can play with toys, watch TV, play electronic games,  
or listen to stories for a long time.  
Do I need to change this?

## Is this normal?
**Yes. This is very common for kids.**
Many children:
- cannot focus in class
- but can focus on games, TV, or stories
This does **not** mean your kid is lazy or bad.
## Why does this happen?
### 1️⃣ Classes are passive*(-  [ˈpæsɪv]消极的; 被动的;)

In class:
- kids must sit still
- listen quietly
- cannot choose what to do
This is hard for many children.
---
### 2️⃣ Games and stories are interesting
Toys, TV, and games:
- move fast
- give rewards（奖赏）
- are fun
So kids focus **without effort**.（- ˈefərt努力; 吃力;）
---
### 3️⃣ Children’s brains are still growing
Kids:
- learn through play
- have short attention spans（ 一段时间）
- need movement
This is normal development.
---
## Do you need to change it?
👉 **Not completely. Do not force（- [fɔːrs]强行） a big change.**
But you can **guide slowly**.
---
## What you can do (simple steps)
### ✅ 1️⃣ Limit screen time, not ban it
- Set clear time (for example: 30–60 minutes)
- Same rule every day
No arguing（- ɑrgjʊɪŋ争吵，辩论）, just routine(-  [ruːˈtiːn]惯例，常规;).

---
### ✅ 2️⃣ Add short “focus time”
- 10–15 minutes only
- Reading, drawing, homework
- Then rest or play

Small time is enough.
---
### ✅ 3️⃣ More outdoor play
Outdoor play:
- helps eyes
- helps attention
- reduces stress

No need to be long.  
Even **20–30 minutes** is good.
---
### ✅ 4️⃣ Don’t compare with other kids

Every child is different.  
Comparing makes kids anxious（- ˈæŋkʃəs焦虑的，担心的）.

---
## When should you worry?
See a professional **only if**:
- the child never listens
- cannot finish any task
- behavior is very extreme（-  [ɪkˈstriːm]极其的; 极端的）

Most children **grow out of this**.
---
## One important thing for parents
> **Children change slowly, not suddenly.**
Your job is:
- guide
- protect
- give structure（- 构造; 建筑物; 周密安排）
    
Not to “fix” them.
You are already a caring（关心的） parent — that matters most.
If you want, next time you can tell me:
- your kid’s age
- what he likes most
