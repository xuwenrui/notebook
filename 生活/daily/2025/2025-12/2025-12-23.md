## Why Do Cats Always Sleep?

Many people think cats always sleep.  
This is because cats sleep more than humans.

First, cats sleep to save energy.  
Cats are hunters by nature.  
Even house cats have the same body as wild cats.  
Sleeping helps them store energy for running and jumping.

Second, cats are more active at night.  
Cats often sleep during the day.  
They wake up early in the morning or at night.  
So we see them sleeping most of the time.

Third, sleep helps cats stay healthy.  
When cats sleep, their body rests and grows.  
Young cats and old cats need more sleep.

Finally, cats sleep more when they feel safe.  
A cat sleeps a lot when it is relaxed and comfortable.  
This means the cat is happy.

In short, cats sleep a lot to save energy, stay healthy, and feel safe.


## Why Does My Cat Always Drop Fur?

It is normal for cats to drop fur.  
All cats lose fur every day.

First, cats drop old fur.  
New fur grows, and old fur falls out.  
This helps keep their coat healthy.

Second, cats drop more fur in some seasons.  
In spring and autumn, cats change their fur.  
So you may see more fur on the floor.

Third, stress(精神压力) can cause fur dropping.  
If a cat feels scared or unhappy, it may lose more fur.

Fourth, health problems can cause fur loss.  
Skin problems, allergies(]过敏症), or poor food can make fur fall out.  
If your cat loses fur in patches or has red skin, see a vet(审查（某人过去的记录、资格等）; 诊疗; 检查).

Finally, brushing(刷光) helps a lot.  
Brushing removes loose fur and keeps your house cleaner.
