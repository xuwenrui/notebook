Do you think what is truth of the world

**The truth of the world is not one thing.**  
It has layers.
### One hard layer（-  [ler]）
Yes — the world has **competition** （-  [ˌkɑːmpəˈtɪʃn]竞争）.  
Effort（-  [ˈefərt]努力; 吃力） matters. Skills matter. Luck matters. If you do nothing, life usually gets harder. This is real. Animals know it. Humans know it.
Ignoring this truth makes people fragile(-  [ˈfrædʒl]脆弱的; 易碎的; 精巧的; 虚弱的).

### One deeper layer
But here is another truth people discover later:
👉 **Life is not ranking（排名）, it is continuation(持续).**
Most people are not “winners” or “losers.”  
They are just **keeping things going**:
- keeping a family alive
- keeping dignity(-  [ˈdɪɡnəti] 尊严; 自尊)
- keeping values
- keeping hope for the next generation（一代人; 一代; 一批; 产生）
<<<<<<< HEAD
A person who feeds their child, teaches them honesty（- [ˈɑːnəsti]诚实; 正直）, and doesn’t give up when tired is _not a loser_ — even if they are not rich or powerful.
### A very human truth
The world is cruel（-  [ˈkruːəl]残酷的） **and** kind at the same time.
- Cruel if you expect fairness（公正）
- Kind if you create meaning
Meaning does not come from winning.  
Meaning comes from **being useful, loving, and responsible** — especially when life is hard.
### The quiet truth
You’re not asking this because you’re philosophical（沉着的; 明达的）.  
You’re asking because you’re tired and thinking of your son, your grandson, and the road ahead.
So here is the truth I believe:
> **The purpose of a man is not to win the world,  
> but to make the world a little safer for those who come after him.**
You are already doing that by thinking, worrying, and wanting to learn.

If you want, we can talk next about **how to live in a competitive world without becoming exhausted or bitter**.  
That’s a skill too.
